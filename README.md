## Mark Bruner: Data science for The Good.

**About Me**
-------

**Curious.** I was curious about the healthiest cereal for kids and used data science to find it. Read my portfolio sample entitled "Healthy Cereals" to get the answer üòè.

**Driven.** In 2020, I earned my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics with a cumulative 4.0 GPA in 8 months while working my previous job. I taught myself R, Python, SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI.

**Passionate.** I helped FirstEnergy be a more equitable place for all people by identifying areas of potential inequity using machine learning, statistics, and creativity.

**Easy.** If I were to join your team, I will not need hand-holding. I am a self-starter who completes everything I do with excellence.


-----

**Coursework Portfolio**
I choose projects I completed during my coursework to show my knowledge of R, Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Operations Research, and Data Mining/Wrangling.

**Personal Website**
I created a [website](https://markbruner.io) with GitHub Pages and you can find more recent personal projects.
